                Hello, traveler ðŸ§™! Welcome to my domain! My name is Yo, and Iâ€™m a humble yet curious 
                high-school coder with a passion for all things tech. Iâ€™ve been exploring the fascinating
                world of programming and have gained some knowledge in languages like HTML, CSS, and 
                Python. At the moment, Iâ€™m diving deeper into JavaScript and enjoying the journey of 
                mastering it to expand my toolkit. Apart from coding, I have a creative side as wellâ€”I 
                love working on design projects using Figma, where I get to bring ideas to life visually.
                <br>
                When Iâ€™m not programming or diving into something new to learn, youâ€™ll probably find me 
                unwinding with my favorite anime, getting lost in a good book, or enjoying an adventure 
                in the world of video games. Itâ€™s great to have you here, and I hope you enjoy exploring 
                this space with me!
            </p>
