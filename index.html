                Welcome to my domain! My name is Yo, and I’m a humble yet curious 
                high-school coder with a passion for all things tech. I’ve been exploring the fascinating
                world of programming and have gained some knowledge in languages like HTML, CSS, and 
                Python. At the moment, I’m diving deeper into JavaScript and enjoying the journey of 
                mastering it to expand my toolkit. Apart from coding, I have a creative side as well—I 
                love working on design projects using Figma, where I get to bring ideas to life visually.
                <br><br>
                When I’m not programming or diving into something new to learn, you’ll probably find me 
                unwinding with my favorite anime, getting lost in a good book, or enjoying an adventure 
                in the world of video games. It’s great to have you here, and I hope you enjoy exploring 
                this space with me!

                <p class="zippy-description">
                    There's a website that you may visit if you like debating but do not have someone to
                    debate with. Zippy is for anyone who wants to do some debating with other human beings
                    or, for the introvert out there, with an AI-powered debate partener. There are pleny of
                    topics with which to engage in some debate. The AI is not as perfect, but an engagement
                    with her on those topics is bound to provoke some discourse, as the AI is created to
                    have a quite strong opinion. The vision of Zippy is to furnish a platform wherein
                    user can engage intellectually in the absence or unavailability of suitable human
                    counterparts for such kind of debate.

                <br>
                <p class="snooke-description">
                    The new Snake game has a different twist to it, with dynamic effects, interactive obstacles, 
                    and portals for the player. Effects such as Frenzy (increased speed), Slow (decreased speed), 
                    Reverse (switching direction), Growth (increased length), and Invert Controls (reversed 
                    commands) increase the breadth of possibilities. The game has highly precise obstacles; 
                    when the snake hits one of them, it dies instantly. The portals provide passages for the 
                    snake from one location to another. This revamped version combines nostalgia with 
                    innovation, offering players a fresh and exciting challenge.

                    This portfolio contains projects of both personal and professional nature that reflect 
                    the experience of creating interesting and innovative solutions. For instance, an 
                    interactive game like a reinvented snake game with different effects and mechanics to a 
                    platform like Zippy where users can debate with an opinionated AI; with these examples, 
                    the portfolio committed to actually combine various functionalities with creative 
                    improvement. Each project stands testimony to my continued commitment to constantly 
                    pushing boundaries, experimenting with new ideas, and delivering enjoyable, 
                    thought-provoking experiences.
