                Welcome to my domain! My name is Yo, and I’m a humble yet curious 
                high-school coder with a passion for all things tech. I’ve been exploring the fascinating
                world of programming and have gained some knowledge in languages like HTML, CSS, and 
                Python. At the moment, I’m diving deeper into JavaScript and enjoying the journey of 
                mastering it to expand my toolkit. Apart from coding, I have a creative side as well—I 
                love working on design projects using Figma, where I get to bring ideas to life visually.
                <br><br>
                When I’m not programming or diving into something new to learn, you’ll probably find me 
                unwinding with my favorite anime, getting lost in a good book, or enjoying an adventure 
                in the world of video games. It’s great to have you here, and I hope you enjoy exploring 
                this space with me!

            <p class="zippy-description">
                There's a website that you may visit if you like debating but do not have someone to
                debate with. Zippy is for anyone who wants to do some debating with other human beings
                or, for the introvert out there, with an AI-powered debate partener. There are pleny of
                topics with which to engage in some debate. The AI is not as perfect, but an engagement
                with her on those topics is bound to provoke some discourse, as the AI is created to
                have a quite strong opinion. The vision of Zippy is to furnish a platform wherein
                user can engage intellectually in the absence or unavailability of suitable human
                counterparts for such kind of debate.
