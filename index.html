                Hey there! My name is Yo, and I am a high-school student who is both humble and inquisitive.
                I am deeply interested in the field of IT and passionate about creating new technology. Also,
                I am engaged in programming and have obtained some knowledge in the area of web development
                such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Python. As of present, my main objective is to get deep
                into JavaScript, which is a challenge by itself and Iâ€™m having an excellent experience
                advancing throughout my programming journey.
                <br><br>
                Aside from coding, I also like playing with physical components like Raspberry Pi, a
                mini-computer that I use to practically get to grips with software and hardware. I am a big
                fan of the marriage of digital functions and physical parts in the invention of technology,
                which playfully stimulates the sense of touch in the very process that I get involved in
                helping with pranks.
                <br><br>
                I am not only into programming, but I do have a creative side as well - I love to work on
                the design of projects by using Figma where I can visually bring a project to life. In my
                spare time, apart from programming and designing, I might be relaxing, but I am usually
                engaged with my favorite anime, indulging in a fantastic read, or taking part in a video
                game's adventure.
                <br><br>
                I am glad to be sharing with you and I hope that your stay on this site will be very
                enjoyable for you. Go ahead and explore this small land with me!

                <p class="zippy-description">
                    There's a website that you may visit if you like debating but do not have someone to
                    debate with. Zippy is for anyone who wants to do some debating with other human beings
                    or, for the introvert out there, with an AI-powered debate partener. There are pleny of
                    topics with which to engage in some debate. The AI is not as perfect, but an engagement
                    with her on those topics is bound to provoke some discourse, as the AI is created to
                    have a quite strong opinion. The vision of Zippy is to furnish a platform wherein
                    user can engage intellectually in the absence or unavailability of suitable human
                    counterparts for such kind of debate.

                <br>
                <p class="snooke-description">
                    The new Snake game has a different twist to it, with dynamic effects, interactive obstacles, 
                    and portals for the player. Effects such as Frenzy (increased speed), Slow (decreased speed), 
                    Reverse (switching direction), Growth (increased length), and Invert Controls (reversed 
                    commands) increase the breadth of possibilities. The game has highly precise obstacles; 
                    when the snake hits one of them, it dies instantly. The portals provide passages for the 
                    snake from one location to another. This revamped version combines nostalgia with 
                    innovation, offering players a fresh and exciting challenge.

                    This portfolio contains projects of both personal and professional nature that reflect 
                    the experience of creating interesting and innovative solutions. For instance, an 
                    interactive game like a reinvented snake game with different effects and mechanics to a 
                    platform like Zippy where users can debate with an opinionated AI; with these examples, 
                    the portfolio committed to actually combine various functionalities with creative 
                    improvement. Each project stands testimony to my continued commitment to constantly 
                    pushing boundaries, experimenting with new ideas, and delivering enjoyable, 
                    thought-provoking experiences.
